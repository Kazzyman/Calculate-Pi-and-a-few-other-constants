This is the main depository of Richard H. Woolley's code. A project that explores several ways to calculate the digits of pi on your own computer.

	For the Windows executable, download Pi-and-friends.exe

	Mac executable is Pi-and-friends-Mac

For the source code to my windows versions, look to the most-recently-dated win-xxx.go file. 

For Linux or MacOS systems, look to the most-recently-dated Unix-xxx.go file.
